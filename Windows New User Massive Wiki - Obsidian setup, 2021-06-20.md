# Windows New User Massive Wiki - Obsidian setup

_by Bill Anderson, 2021-06-20. last updated 2021-09-22_.

Software installs have been done (in this order):

1. Git-for-windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Git-Credential-Manager-Core: https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core/releases/tag/v2.0.498
3. GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
	- Login and clone a repository to use as an Obsidian vault
4. Obsidian: https://obsidian.md/
	- setup Obsidian:Git

Now we test the setup by attempting to commit and push this file to the GitHub repository.

Success!

- Initiating Push in Obsidian brings up a GitHub dialog box requesting login to GitHub via browser (or entry of an access key).
- GitHub opens to dialog box requesting authorization; click the green button.
- Authentication succeeds *and* Obsidian completes the Push operation.
