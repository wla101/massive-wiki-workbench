# 2022-11-26 OneDrive testing notes

Today's testing involves using a vault that resides on a local OneDrive directory in two places:
1. Bill's iMac OneDrive directory; and
2. a directory on a Windows10 VM

The directory houses a Github repository and the main testing is to see how well Obsidian-git works with vaults held in OneDrive folders.

Initial testing is on Bill's iMac with this very notes file.
 - stage, commit, and push this thing
