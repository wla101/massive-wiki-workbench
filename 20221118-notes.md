# 2022-11-18 notes

1. getting familiar once again with Windows

2. installed Notepad++ just to have something other than Notepad
  - may live to rue this decision
  
3. bootstrapping into Massive Wiki userland (enumerate the steps taken)

3.1. install Obsidian from https://obsidian.md - DONE

3.2. install Git via https://git-scm.com/download/win
 - Options chosen during install
   - Notepad++ chosen as default editor
   - Override default branch name for new repos - use "main"
   - Adjusting PATH env - choose what is Recommended
   - Use bundled OpenSSH
   - Use the OpenSSL library
   - Configuring line ending conversions (use Checkout Windows-style)
   - Which terminal emulator for Git Bash? (use MinTTY)
   - default `git pull` behavior (use Default)
   - choose credential helper (use Git Credential Manager)
   - config extra options? (Enable file system caching was checked)
   - do NOT select experimental options
   
 - Git Bash is installed and can be very helpful for checking on file and
 filesystem details in Obsidian vaults and other Massive Wiki containers.
