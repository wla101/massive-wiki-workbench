# 2022-11-21 notes

- so yesterday I got confused by trying to use Github Desktop to force authorization. I think I assumed that installing Git for Windows was going to set everything up, even though the notes from June 2021 implied something different. Oh well.
- this morning I committed all the changes that were pending using GH Desktop.
- now I will try to commit and push this note from Obsidian-git

(oh, look: .obsidian/workspace.json has changed ...)
