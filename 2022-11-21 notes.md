# 2022-11-21 notes

- so yesterday I got confused by trying to use Github Desktop to force authorization. I think I assumed that installing Git for Windows was going to set everything up, even though the notes from June 2021 implied something different. Oh well.
- this morning I committed all the changes that were pending using GH Desktop.
- now I will try to commit and push this note from Obsidian-git

(oh, look: .obsidian/workspace.json has changed ...
 it appears to show up as changed automatically )

- this time I was prompted to login to Github to authorize the push and a big green button to authorize this application showed up. I pushed it.
-  let's see if that enables Obsidian-git to work
 - and yes it seems to.
 - we will need another clean machine to test out the steps but I think the June 2021 instructions work, but there is not a seperate step needed to install Git credential manager.
